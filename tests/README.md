# Tests

I've tried to use more system tests, which test the system completely end-to-end.

## Unit Tests

A level of the software testing process where individual units/components of a software/system are tested. 
The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.

## Integration Tests

A level of the software testing process where individual units are combined and tested as a group.
The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units.


## System Tests

A level of the software testing process where a complete, integrated system/software is tested.
The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the specified requirements.
