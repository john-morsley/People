# Users

An ASP.NET application for users.

As we are going to implement a CQRS approach, I have split the read and write parts of the API into separate projects. They can now be deployed and scaled independently. 

## Read API

- GET

## Write API

- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE

## Tests

### Unit Tests

### Integration Tests

### System Tests
